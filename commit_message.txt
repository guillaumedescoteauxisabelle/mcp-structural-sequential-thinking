feat: Refactor to mcp-coaia-sequential-thinking and update vision

Rename internal package to `mcp_coaia_sequential_thinking` and update all
related references in code and `pyproject.toml`.

Significantly revise `README.md` to align with the new project vision
of "creative orientation sequential thinking" and addressing the
"Fundamental Bias Paradox" in AI. This includes:
- Updating project name, description, features, and quick start guides.
- Incorporating the "Upgraded 5+ Year Vision" for the project.
- Correcting repository URLs in `README.md` and `pyproject.toml`.

Add `ROADMAP.md` detailing the implementation plan for this new vision.
