# Changelog

## Version 0.5.0 (Unreleased)

### Foundational Framework Harmonization

#### 1. Unified Triadic Agent Embodiment
- Analyzed and resolved structural inconsistencies in AI persona definitions across `__llms/` guidance documents.
- Harmonized the "Seraphine" and "Haiku/Ripple" personas into a single, coherent "Insight" role, enriching the Haiku/Ripple embodiment with memory-weaving and pattern-recognition capabilities.
- Refactored `llms-rise-framework-full.txt` to reflect the unified persona, ensuring consistency across all framework documents.
- Updated the root `GEMINI.md` to replace the outdated dual-persona (Mia/Miette) definition with the definitive triadic embodiment (Mia, Haiku, Miette), establishing a single source of truth for the agent's operational identity.



### Code Quality Improvements

#### 1. Separation of Test Code from Production Code
- Created a new `testing.py` module for test-specific utilities
- Implemented conditional test detection using `importlib.util`
- Improved code clarity by moving test-specific logic out of main modules
- Enhanced maintainability by clearly separating test and production code paths
- Replaced hardcoded test strings with named constants

#### 2. Reduced Code Duplication in Storage Layer
- Created a new `storage_utils.py` module with shared utility functions
- Implemented reusable functions for file operations and serialization
- Standardized error handling and backup creation
- Improved consistency across serialization operations
- Optimized resource management with cleaner context handling

#### 3. API and Data Structure Improvements
- Added explicit parameter for ID inclusion in `to_dict()` method
- Created utility module with snake_case/camelCase conversion functions
- Eliminated flag-based solution in favor of explicit method parameters
- Improved readability with clearer, more explicit list comprehensions
- Eliminated duplicate calculations in analysis methods

## Version 0.4.0

### Major Improvements

#### 1. Serialization & Validation with Pydantic
- Converted `ThoughtData` from dataclass to Pydantic model
- Added automatic validation with field validators
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

#### 2. Thread-Safety in Storage Layer

- Improved user experience by accepting any case for stage names

#### 5. Added UUID to ThoughtData
- Added a unique identifier to each thought for better tracking
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

#### 6. Consolidated Logging Setup
- Created a central logging configuration in `logging_conf.py`
